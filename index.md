As a collection of atoms and molecules myself, I am interested in how the chemical matter of the universe can evolve into biological systems, and how likely this process is. In Fall 2020 I will enter the Penn State Chemistry Graduate program and work toward an understanding of the role of RNA and membrane vesicles in the origins of life on Earth.

### Undergraduate research: Interstellar ice astrochemistry

A supply of prebiotic molecules are necessary for abiogenesis. The exogenous delivery hypothesis involves the delivery of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids by comets; the molecules would first be synthesized in dark, dense molecular clouds,  then incorporated into and preserved in comets as the accretion disk and stellar system form, and finally delivered to planets. My experimental research as an undergraduate focused on pure ammonia or pure methanol ices created in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber which simulated interstellar conditions. The ices were irradiated with low-energy electrons or photons and temperature-programmed desorption quadropole mass spectrometry was used to determine irradiation products. We found [dimer- and trimerization of ammonia](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsearthspacechem.8b00169) at 77K following both electron and photon irradiation, and more complex species such as ethylene glycol (commonly used as antifreeze) in 77K methanol ices.
